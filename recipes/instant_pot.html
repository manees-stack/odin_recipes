Close the valve and select the Soup function according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 3 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</p></li>
        <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Add pastina and stir to combine. Replace the lid. Close the valve and select the Soup function according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 3 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and stir. Let soup sit for 5 minutes so pasta will be fully cooked and spinach will be wilted. Season with salt to taste.</li>
